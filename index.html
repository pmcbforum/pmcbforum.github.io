          <p><strong>PMCB Share and Account holders Forum</strong> has been conceptualised with the intent of united actions for resolution of <em>PMC Bank</em> issues by initiating actions on all requisite fronts for protection of depositors and shareholders interests by coordinating with authorities- RBI, State Government, Central Government, etc. and initiate legal actions- Civil and Criminal.</p>
          <p>Our emphasis is for recovery of our hard earned 100% monies and consistent efforts will be put in with the endeavour of recapitalisation/ restructuring/ merger /revival of the Bank and thereby protection of our monies.</p>
          <p>All of us- PMC Bank depositors and Shareholders are facing the same dilemma and need to be united for satisfying our common goal of recovery of our 100% monies.</p>      
          <h3 style="color: #ff00ff; font-weight: bold">REALITY CHECK AS ON DATE :</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>No Entity in sight for merger.</li>
            <li>No fund infusion or aid by any govt/no help from political parties.</li>
            <li>Only informal intimation by RBI appointed Administrator about Interest free loan from DICGC for revival plan around 4500 CR.</li>
            <li>RBI 35A extension letter commits in writing of bank revival exclusively.</li>
            <li>Administrator informally admits of sending revival plan to RBI.(plan Details unknown).</li>
            <li>Response from RBI on revival awaited.</li>
            <li>Practical revival calculations as per known sources makes Bail in option by Equity & Bond conversion inescapable to restart the Bank.(conversion % not known)</li>
            <li>Revival does not mean closure of all other options like merger etc. later on.(In fact a pre-step to merger to avoid losing our hard earned monies).</li>
          </ol>
          <h3 style="color: #ff00ff; font-weight: bold">OUR PLANS PROPOSED :</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Study the merits of the revival plan as & when made available to us by RBI.</li>
            <li>React on the same with mutual consent of PMC victims subsequently.</li>
            <li>In the meanwhile Importantly gather the database in advance of all the bank customers in small whatsapp or telegram groups who are ready to start the bank by accepting the Bail in revival option anticipated from RBI in due course.</li>
            <li>Reason for this data base collection of like minded bank customers is to speed up the revival process by quickly approaching such groups for updating on revival plans & obtaining their written consents if required later on without waste of time as RBI may give only limited time for raising objections.</li>
            <li>In case the proposed Revival Plan is unsuitable for the depositors, initiating the process of raising objections instantaneously and if necessary also challenging the proposal in the appropriate Courts of Law immediately to protect the interest of depositors.</li>
            <li>At this moment we are not planning to give any counter revival plans to RBI. (WAIT AND WATCH FOR RBI PLAN)</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>ALERT:</strong> ONE WRONG STEP BY US CAN MAKE US LOOSE OUR HARD EARNED MONEY.</p>
